## Self-Reflection:
This lab was very difficult to follow as many steps were left out of the assignment and the student is required to fill in the gaps for an automatic grading program that appears to be innacurate as I followed the instructions and it keeps persisting with a fail despite having all the required sections. A full video detailing how each step is completed and how the part we are learning functions would have been helpful. Even comparing with my classmates who have submitted almost identical assignments to see where I may have went wrong did not work for the autograder so I am assuming most all students are failing for this assignment.

### How long it took me to finish this?
30 Minutes for the actual assignment completion, multiple hours of troubleshooting to try and get the autograder to work with no avail.
